Introduction

Decades of research in conservation have sought to answer the question: "where do migratory organisms go (Webster & Marra, 2005)?" 
Implementing effective conservation programs for annually-migrating organisms is challenging because 1) stressors and sources of mortality often vary across the migratory cycle, 2) these factors are confounded by the varying composition of populations at each migratory stage, and 3) migration routes often cross international boundaries. 1) In migratory birds, the breeding and migration 

n other words, the individuals in a breeding population of a passerine bird may contribute to more than one wintering population, or vice versa. 

Migration routes often cross international boundaries




Thick-billed and common murres (Uria lomvia and U. aalge, respectively) are pertinent targets of conservation because 1) they are important for the stability of circumpolar marine trophic networks, 2) they are integral to the culture of northern indigenous peoples and settled people of Newfoundland and Labrador, and 3) their populations are continuously impacted by anthropogenic activity.

Fluctuations in murre populations may destabilize circumpolar marine trophic networks because murres comprise a significant portion of the biomass of the northern hemisphere pelagic fauna. Murre breeding colonies are found throughout the northern hemisphere, and their current global population is estimated to be (HOW MANY MILLION BIRDS?????). Throughout the year, murres feed on small pelagic and benthic prey (SENTENCE ABOUT BIOMASS OF NORTHERN OCEANS). (SENTENCE ABOUT ESTIMATED IMPACT)

Murres are cultural 
Northern indigenous communities rely on murres for nutrition year-round, and coastal, settled communities in Newfoundland and Labrador harvest and eat murres as a cultural tradition.

Newfoundland and Labrador harvest 
70s - 600,000 - 900,000 annually
currently - 100,000
no regulation pre-1994
regulation in place 1994

TBMU
Greenland some colonies extirpated, numbers reduced by more than 50%
Northwest declines since 1950s
increasing in North America as of 2007
whole European population trend unknown
Least concern in Europe as well

COMU
sharp decline in Iceland since 2000
though a number of populations increasing (including UK which holds nearly half European population)
Increasing in North America as of 2007

MBTA - Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918
- auks deemed migratory non-game birds - no Canadians could legally hunt them
- 1949, Newfoundland joins Canada and MBTA amended to allow Newfoundlanders to harvest murres between Septemver 1st and March 31st with no permit nor bag limit

- 90s - "The Minister may, where has reasonable cause to believe that it is necessary for conservation purposes, vary any hunting period or quota set out in these Regulations"

- Environment Canada conducted survey 1996-97 hunting season in Newfoundland
- asked how many permit-owners were hunting murres
- found that most people wanted a bag limit of 20 or fewer birds per person, complaints about market gunners


Murre populations are negatively impacted by anthropogenic activity, particularly at the wintering range.

 including gillnet bycatch, marine pollution, oil development, and harvest. Murres are affected by climate change both directly by way of changes in sea ice cover during winter and indirectly by way of
