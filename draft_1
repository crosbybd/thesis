Introduction

Decades of research in conservation have sought to answer the question: "where do migratory organisms go (Webster & Marra, 2005)?" 
Implementing effective conservation programs for annually-migrating organisms is challenging because 1) stressors and sources of mortality often vary across the migratory cycle, 2) these factors are confounded by the varying composition of populations at each migratory stage, and 3) migration routes often cross international boundaries. 1) In migratory birds, the breeding and migration 

n other words, the individuals in a breeding population of a passerine bird may contribute to more than one wintering population, or vice versa.
