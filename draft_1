Introduction

Decades of research in conservation have sought to answer the question: "where do migratory organisms go (Webster & Marra, 2005)?" Understanding annual migration and migratory patterns of populations is pertinent because migration is widespread across vertebrate taxa, and this phenomenon poses challenges to conservation research and management. Implementing effective conservation programs for annually-migrating organisms is challenging due to seasonal interactions and migratory connectivity. Seasonal interactions comprise the wintering conditions that affect breeding populations, and vice versa. Seasonal interactions can be confounded by migratory connectivity which refers to the degree to which specific breeding and wintering populations are connected (Webster et al., 2002). If all of the individuals in a breeding population migrate to an exclusive wintering area, thereby maintaining a specific year-round population, this population exhibits strong migratory connectivity. Conversely, if all of the individuals of several breeding populations migrate in equal proportion to several wintering areas, these populations exhibit weak migratory connectivity.


Lots of evidence exists to suggest that recruitment to a breeding population can be significantly affected by conditions at the wintering area.

Notably, in monarch butterflies, a winter mass mortality event occurred when a storm caused temperatures in montane Mexico to drop below tolerable levels (-5 degrees Celsius). Over two days, as many as 300 million individuals in Mexico died, but individuals wintering in California were not affected by the storm. Prior knowledge about migratory connectivity between these winter populations and monarch summer populations (Brower 1995) was used to determine that 

Lots of evidence suggests that seasonal interactions significantly affect recruitment to breeding populations. In monarch butterflies, a 2002 storm 

Thick-billed and common murres (Uria lomvia and U. aalge, respectively) are pertinent targets of conservation because they are integral to the cultures of northern indigenous peoples and settled, coastal communities of Newfoundland and Labrador, and anthropogenic activity has been continuously detrimental to murre populations.

As migratory seabirds, murres require 


because they are integral to the cultures of northern indigenous peoples and settled, coastal communities in Newfoundland and Labrador and because local murre populations have experienced severe declines and local extirpations in certain areas.


Declines in east Atlantic murre breeding populations (mainland Norway, Svalbard, Iceland) have been attributed to shifts in ocean regime due to climatic ocillations, but the impact of harvest on these populations is unknown.


Fluctuations in murre populations may destabilize circumpolar marine trophic networks because murres comprise a significant portion of the biomass of the northern hemisphere pelagic fauna. Murre breeding colonies are found throughout the northern hemisphere, and their current global population is estimated to be (HOW MANY MILLION BIRDS?????). Throughout the year, murres feed on small pelagic and benthic prey (SENTENCE ABOUT BIOMASS OF NORTHERN OCEANS). (SENTENCE ABOUT ESTIMATED IMPACT)

Descamps et al 2013
- Svalbard experienced rapid declines in 2000s - likely associated with subpolar gyre - a change in oceanic regime

Irons et al 2008
- "murre diets differ throughout their range in accordance to distinct water temperatures"
- North Atlantic, Arctic cod and sculpin important for TBMUs in high arctic areas
- capelin and gadoid species such as Atlantic cod dominate diet in low arctic
- Atlantic COMUs depend largely on capelin in low arctic, while those breeding in boreal zone prey much on herring and sandlance
- fish pops sensitive to shifts in ocean regime and long-term climate changes
- results of this study suggest that relatively large climate shifts, irrespective of direction, may have had negative consequences for marine food webs and hence for murre populations

subsistence hunt

Northern indigenous communities rely on murres for nutrition year-round, and coastal, settled communities in Newfoundland and Labrador harvest and eat murres as a cultural tradition.

local declines and extirpations a result of increased population size, mechanized boats, and firearms

Newfoundland and Labrador harvest 
70s - 600,000 - 900,000 annually
currently - 100,000
no regulation pre-1994
regulation in place 1994

TBMU
Greenland some colonies extirpated, numbers reduced by more than 50%
Northwest declines since 1950s
increasing in North America as of 2007
whole European population trend unknown
Least concern in Europe as well

COMU
sharp decline in Iceland since 2000
though a number of populations increasing (including UK which holds nearly half European population)
Increasing in North America as of 2007

MBTA - Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918
- auks deemed migratory non-game birds - no Canadians could legally hunt them
- 1949, Newfoundland joins Canada and MBTA amended to allow Newfoundlanders to harvest murres between Septemver 1st and March 31st with no permit nor bag limit

- 90s - "The Minister may, where has reasonable cause to believe that it is necessary for conservation purposes, vary any hunting period or quota set out in these Regulations"

- Environment Canada conducted survey 1996-97 hunting season in Newfoundland
- asked how many permit-owners were hunting murres
- found that most people wanted a bag limit of 20 or fewer birds per person, complaints about market gunners


Murre populations are negatively impacted by anthropogenic activity, particularly at the wintering range.

 including gillnet bycatch, marine pollution, oil development, and harvest. Murres are affected by climate change both directly by way of changes in sea ice cover during winter and indirectly by way of 

murre populations fluctuate with shifts in ocean regime and sea surface temperature
