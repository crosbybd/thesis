CHAPTER 1 – INTRODUCTION
Migratory Connectivity and the Conservation of Migratory Organisms
Decades of research in conservation have sought to answer the question: "where do migratory organisms go (Webster & Marra, 2005)?" Annual migration is a widespread phenomenon across vertebrate taxa that poses challenges to conservation. Disentangling the demographic effects of seasonal interactions and migratory connectivity is necessary to determine a migratory population's conservation needs. Seasonal interactions refer to a population's demographic events or environmental conditions that carry over from one migratory stage and impact the individuals or population at another migratory stage (Webster & Marra, 2005). For example, in North American monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus), a storm at one overwintering area resulted in the mortality of up to 300 million individuals, and this severe decline was evident in the summer population the following year (Brower et al., 2004). Seasonal interactions can be confounded by migratory connectivity which refers to the degree to which specific breeding and wintering populations are connected (Webster et al., 2002). If all of the individuals in a breeding population migrate to a single wintering area, thereby maintaining an exclusive year-round population, this population exhibits strong migratory connectivity. Conversely, weak migratory connectivity occurs if all of the individuals of several breeding populations migrate in equal proportion to several wintering areas. Weak migratory connectivity and varying seasonal interactions across populations have the greatest potential to confound demographic trends.

Example with shorebirds (Iwamura et al., 2013)

Seabird Conservation and Migratory Connectivity
	Conserving pelagic seabirds is pertinent, and determining migratory connectivity in their populations would greatly improve the efficacy of conservation and management of their populations. Pelagic seabirds include globally-distributed birds from several clades that forage and overwinter in the marine environment. They are more threatened than all other avian clades with comparable numbers of species, and most of their threats primarily affect overwintering populations (Croxall et al., 2012). Pelagic seabirds are often long-lived with low fecundity, and, as a result, their populations are sensitive to adult survival rate (Doherty et al., 2004; Jenouvrier et al., 2005). Anthropogenic sources of mortality at sea such as oil development and pollution (Votier et al., 2005), bycatch (Anderson et al., 2011), and in some cases, harvest (Circumpolar Seabird Group, 2008) are capable of inducing mass die-offs of adults. Climate change affects adult survival of pelagic seabirds by reducing populations of forage fish (Schreiber & Schreiber, 1984; Barbraud & Weimerskirch, 2001) and by increasing the frequency of extreme weather events which can misplace migratory populations of birds, resulting in mortality (Newton, 2007).

The arctic, Earth’s fastest-changing region, supports millions of seabirds year-round. Climate change has reduced the prominence of sea ice which is known to affect seabird breeding phenology and availability of prey.


As apex predators in marine ecosystems with obvious terrestrial breeding populations, pelagic seabirds can act as sentinels for monitoring the health of the marine environment (Furness & Camphuysen, 1997; Mallory et al., 2010).

Though migratory connectivity in seabirds has not been measured, studies aimed at discovering their migratory patterns and overwintering areas suggest that breeding populations do not form discrete overwintering populations, and these patterns vary year-to-year. Life history traits of seabirds also suggest non-discrete overwintering populations. From what we know, seabird migratory routes are dictated by forage food distributions. Environmental factors play a smaller role in limiting migration corridors on the open ocean compared to migration corridors on land. Prevailing winds and oceanic currents are known to affect migration corridors in some seabirds, but more research is needed to understand how these affect seabirds generally.
Murre Demography
	Thick-billed and common murres (Uria lomvia and U. aalge, respectively) comprise an important and effective system for studying migratory connectivity concerning conservation. Murres breed throughout the northern hemisphere on coastal cliffs. Thick-billed murres are known for breeding at arctic and sub-arctic latitudes while common murres breed at boreal and temperate latitudes, however, the two species’ ranges overlap significantly at intermediate latitudes. The global murre population exceeds 30 million individuals, and some breeding colonies support as many as one million. Many breeding colonies have stable populations, but severe, local breeding colony declines are known, and several extirpations have occurred in the past 50 years. Colonies in arctic Europe, including those on mainland Norway, Svalbard, and Iceland are experiencing potentially severe declines. Svalbard-breeding thick-billed murres have declined by 15-45% in the past twenty years. At this rate, this colony may be extirpated in 50 years (Descamps et al., 2013). Thick-billed murres breeding on Bjornoya (one island belonging to the Svalbard archipelago) have experienced a significant decrease in adult survival in the past 15 years resulting in population declines. Declines at Svalbard have been attributed to climatic oscillations, but other factors may also be influencing this trend. The extent of declines in Iceland and mainland Norway are lesser known. Iceland declines appear to synchronize with those of Greenland, suggesting that factors during the nonbreeding period are similarly impacting these colonies.

- role of harvest in Greenland declines
- should information about Newfoundland hunt appear before talking about murre demography? Provides context for talking about population trends
Murre Harvest and its Implications for Breeding Populations
-Harvest important culturally, both in circumpolar settled communities and circumpolar indigenous communities
-Newfoundland harvest claims 100,000 murres every winter
-Historically 600,000-900,000 (pre-regulations)
-harvest in Greenland resulted in several extirpations – possible cause of declines
-we know thick-billed murres migrate from Europe to SW Greenland and Newfoundland, but in what numbers?
Scientific Question
To estimate impacts of the Newfoundland harvest on breeding populations of thick-billed and common murres in the Atlantic Ocean, I asked, “what portion of murres harvested during the Newfoundland hunt breed at each Atlantic colony?” In addressing this question, I generated molecular markers from murres taken in Newfoundland and conducted a population assignment to populations throughout the Atlantic breeding distribution of both species.
